          <h3><strong>Academics</strong></h3>
          <p>
            Outstanding learning experiences are crafted through a challenging curriculum with a lateral-spatial and analytical approach that allows our students to reflect and think as they apply their learning to everyday life. Children undertake live projects in which they survey, explore data, debate, analyze and make presentation. In addition to the curricular areas, there is huge focus on variety of co- curricular activities like Music, Art, Pottery, Games, and Life skill training to ensure holistic development of the child.
